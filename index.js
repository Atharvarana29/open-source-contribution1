// this is what i have learnt
// first you have to do fork in the repo (of someone's that in which 
// you want to contribute ) . then choose the name of the repo  that you want to keep
// this will be  the name of your repository in which you will be doing the changes ,
// because you can't directly import the repo and start doing the changes
// the click on create a repo ,  now a repo of your choice name has got created and you can do changes in it
// we do not do the changes directly in git hub as it just  offers code base and repo managment like featuers
// so we import that repo which we have forked and renamed , to vs code folder throug git
// we use command git clone <forked repo url> and then the vs code automatically clone of the files and folders 
// of the repo with the custom name given by us to the repo in the choosen folder .
// now here we can do what ever changes we want to do in different files and folders 
// for eg:- in the html file , react file and all...
// the with all the changes done (here perfer to do one specific change at a time , so  that even if it does 
// not work or has some issues in the future then also then come to this specific commit id and correct it )
// and now as usual we have written the code so now we have to add it and then commit it and then push it .
// to github. 
// 


console.log("this is the first fork , that i am doing . have written all the things above")
